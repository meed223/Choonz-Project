# Choonz-Starter

'Choonz' is a Music site similar to Spotify, designed as part of my final project with QA Academy.
The goal of this project was to design both front-end and back-end of an application as well as to deliver a full test-suite as part of a team.

This is a fork of the repository from the github I used during training onto my personal github.

## Concept

The 'Choonz' website will allow a user to browse music, being able to look at tracks, artists, albums, genres - as well as being able to view and make playlists.

This should be scaleable from 3 to 5+ entities:

- **MUST HAVE** - Track, Artist, Album
- **SHOULD HAVE** - Genre, Playlist
- **COULD HAVE** - Login System (restrict playlist creation to logged in users)

## Specifications
### Technical Requirements
- Maven
- Java 14
- Some IDE either Eclipse or Intellij
- Springboot for your IDE
- [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

**Required Libraries:** (included in *pom.xml*)
- Springboot Framework (v 2.3.4)
- Model Mapper (v 2.3.5)
- Selenium (v 3.141.59)

- JUnit 5 (v 5.6.2)
- Springfox (3.0.0)

### Client Requirements / Feature-Set
**General**
- Multiple users can sign up to the system

## Setting-Up Development
1. Ensure you have the required tools (see Technical requirements)
2. Clone this repository or download it as a *.zip* file and un-pack it. Open the project in Eclipse or Intellij, setting it up as a Maven project.
3. Run the 'ChoonzApplication.java' file in `src/com/qa/choonz` - this is the main runner for the Springboot application.
4. The application should be hosted as 'localhost:8082/'
  
**Note:** To run Selenium tests, you will need to download ['Chromedriver.exe'](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (*or a web-driver for your preferred browser*) and place it under `src/test/resources/drivers/`
